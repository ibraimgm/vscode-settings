	// Place your snippets for json here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Golang Debug (VS Code Launch)": {
		"prefix": "godebugvscode",
		"description": "Debug config for golang",
		"body":[
			"{",
			"\t\"name\": \"Debug Go App\",",
      "\t\"type\": \"go\",",
      "\t\"request\": \"launch\",",
      "\t\"mode\": \"debug\",",
			"\t// program should be the location of the main module",
			"\t// NOTE: Put '$', '{' and '}' on the line below (snippet scaping issues)",
      "\t\"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/src\",",
      "\t\"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",",
			"\t// only valid for $GOPATH",
